    "- Dependent Variable: The dependent variable for the model is bikes_available_ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    " - R-squared: The R-squared value is 0.022, which means that approximately 2.2% of the variance in the bikes_available_ratio can be explained by the independent variables included in the model. This is a very low value, suggesting that the model does not explain much of the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- F-statistic: The F-statistic is 30.84 with a very low probability (p-value) of 7.66e-37, suggesting that the overall model is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- all independent variables have p-values below threshhold, therefore are statistically significant\n",
    "##### Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The const coefficient indicates that the average bikes_available_ratio, when all other variables are zero, is 19.12%.\n",
    "- rating has a positive effect on the bikes_available_ratio with a coefficient of 0.0616\n",

    "- price categories must be interpreted in relation to the reference category: price_2\n",
    "    - price_1 has a negative coefficient, implying that a proximity to lower priced venues correlates with less bikes available\n",
    "    - price_3, is positive, having a coefficient of 0.0174, immplying that proximity to higher priced venues correlates with more bikes available\n",
    "    - price_4 continues the trend, its coeffient is double that of price_3, meaning that the highest priced venues are most strongly correlated with more bike availability\n",
    "- venue_to_station_distance has a negative effect on the bikes_available_ratio, meaning that the higher its distance to nearby venues, the less bikes will be available at the station\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation\n",
    "Its possible to interpret bike availability in 2 contradicting ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A higher availability ratio is due to that station being LESS popular, implying that the nearby venues are LESS desirable.\n",
    "2. A higher availability ratio is due to that station is MORE popular: customers frequently ride their bikes TO the area and dropping them off at that station, implying the nearby venues are MORE desirable.\n",

    "- It becomes difficult to draw meaningful conclusions without more supporting data that would help determine which of these two scenarios is most likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, one has to consider that the station data was a snapshot, representing the state of the bike stations at the time of the API call. The station data for this project was taken on 2023-12-09 @ 13:39:21. (2PM on a Saturday during winter). The inferences drawn from the bike station data must be considered in the context of day vs weekday, season, local weather, and time of day. These will all have a massive influence on whether the bike availability is representative of use patterns for patrons of nearby venues."
